A work-in-progress save and mod file editor for The Elderscrolls III: Morrowind. It is intended as a replacement for Enchanted Editor, which I've found to have serious file corruption issues when used with Windows 8 in particular.

It currently runs in command line, php editor.php. Any parameters have to be set in the code itself, it is not yet interactive.
